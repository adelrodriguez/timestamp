# Timestamp Microservice

This a Full Stack Javascript app that takes a string as a parameter, checks whether that string contains either an Unix timestamp or a natural language date, and then does the following:

* If it contains either, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
* Otherwise, it returns null on both.

Made using [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/).
